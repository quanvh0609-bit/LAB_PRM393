# Exercise 2 – Collections & Operators

## Goal
Work with List, Set, Map and operators (+, -, ==, &&, ? :) in Dart.

## What This Exercise Demonstrates

### 1. List Operations
- Creating a List of integers
- Accessing elements by index
- Adding elements with `add()`
- Removing elements with `remove()`

### 2. Operators
- **Arithmetic operators**: +, -, *, /, ~/ (integer division), % (modulo)
- **Comparison operators**: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
- **Logical operators**: && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT)
- **Ternary operator**: condition ? value1 : value2

### 3. Set Operations
- Creating a Set with unique values
- Adding elements (duplicates are ignored)
- Removing elements
- Demonstrating uniqueness constraint

### 4. Map Operations
- Creating a Map with key-value pairs
- Accessing values by key
- Adding new entries
- Updating existing entries
- Removing entries
- Checking key existence
- Iterating through entries

## How to Run

Make sure Dart SDK is installed and in your PATH, then run:

```bash
dart run bin/lab2_ex2.dart
```

Or using Flutter:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run bin/lab2_ex2.dart
```

## Expected Output

The program will display:
- List operations (create, index, add, remove)
- Arithmetic calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo)
- Comparison results (equality, inequality, greater than, less than)
- Logical operations (AND, OR, NOT)
- Ternary operator results
- Set operations (create, add, remove, uniqueness)
- Map operations (create, access, add, update, remove, iterate)

## Learning Objectives

✅ Understanding List indexing and manipulation  
✅ Using arithmetic and comparison operators  
✅ Working with logical operators (&&, ||, !)  
✅ Applying ternary operator (? :)  
✅ Creating and managing Sets with unique values  
✅ Working with Maps (key-value pairs)  
✅ Performing CRUD operations on collections
